# Hello, World!

The Hello, World! program is a classic among computer programmers. Due to being a very simple program, it's generally the first one a programmer writes when learning a new language. Hello, World! is a good first challenge for those who are just starting in the programming world, since it leaves room to learn other things like how to write and run code, or the basics of command line interfaces.
